# Our Values

.pull-left[
**At The Carpentries, we..**  
Act Openly     
Empower One Another    
_Value All Contributions_

]
.pull-right[
**We are...**    
_Always Learning_    
Inclusive of All    
]
.center[
**We champion...**   
_People First_    
Access for All    
Community Collaboration    
Strength Through Diversity
]

???

What makes us stand out is not the fact that we use evidence-based practices in
teaching, it's that we align all of our decisions with our core values: we put
people first and we value all contributions.

---

## Our Lessons

???

Our lessons are distributed as open-licensed websites built on a consistent
style that adheres to active learning principals. We use these lessons as the
source material for the hundreds of workshops we run each year. So, these sites
have three distinct audiences:

1. The certified Carpentries Instructors who refer to these materials as
   they teach our workshops.
2. The learners in a Carpentries workshop who rely on these lessons after a workshop
   as they review and practice their newly aquired skills.
3. The educators who adapt these open-licensed materials for their own
   lessons.

---

## We Act Openly

???

The source for these lessons are hosted on GitHub where
volunteer Maintainers ensure that the lessons are
accurate and up-to-date. We encourage a culture of open contribution,
where members of our community can suggest a
simple typo fix or a better
explanation of an important lesson concept. We want **anyone** can go to the repository and
make a suggestion to improve our lessons... at least that was our intention.

---

## Desire Paths

???

I want to pause for a second here and highlight this tweet that came across my
feed as I was preparing this talk.

<https://twitter.com/SarahNicholas/status/1401510907604353024?s=20>

It shows a fork between a paved path and an unpaved footpath across a patch of
grass, which leads to a crosswalk. There is a sign in front of the unpaved path
that says "Please use the purpose made path provided." The tweet author points
out that "the sign knows it has lost."

This unofficial footpath is called a "desire path". It is an
important concept in design because it shows the difference between what
the designers intended and how people actually use the space.

---

## Desire Paths? In OUR community?

???

As our community has grown, new desire paths were being created across our
lesson infrastructure landscape. No signs (i.e., better documentation) would
stop contributors to our lessons from stepping outside the complex, and not
always well-paved, path that makes up our lesson infrastructure. we have been
noticing more and more of these desire We needed to rethink our infrastructure
altogether in a way that is more inclusive and welcoming for everyone.

---

## R savior!

???

We found that the R publishing ecosystem is flexible enough to give
us the tools we need **to reduce barriers for publishing lessons and
further our mission**. I will introduce you to our current
infrastructure, its unique challenges, our solutions, and how we used past and
present feedback from our community to iteratively refine our design.

Before continuing, I want to remind everyone of two things. First:

---

Greg Wilson wrote this after several iterations of the lesson
infrastructure. I am putting it here as a reminder that the infrastructure we have
now was working for us at the time. What we come up with will have its
own difficulties down the road, but what is important is that we build something
that better addresses the needs of our community, which leads me to my second
reminder:

???

As the community has grown, our infrastructure has been put to the test and we
have continuously updated our workflows to make it easier for people to contribute.
The reason we do this is because our values are what drive us. In The Carpentries, you
belong, no matter if you have been working as a systems administrator for a
university HPC cluster or if you have just learned to write your first R script.

To better understand the decisions we are making, let's start by reviewing
our current infrastructure.

## Infrastructure

???

Our lessons are written in markdown and into a website via GitHub Pages and
the Jekyll static site generator. The idea behind this choice was that it was
the most straightforward way to create a static website without needing a server
like Wordpress or Drupal sites. Ideally, it also provided a way for people to
use this as an example of how they could build their own website.

The paradigm of being able to write markdown lessons and get a functional website
out of it is not a new concept. In fact, there are over 460 iterations of
this concept according to https://staticsitegenerators.net. Jekyll happens to
be the one that GitHub implemented early on to provide documentation for the
open-source project it hosted, and thus, it stuck.

---

## Our Infrastructure

???


We created an all-in-one bundle for lessons that provided styling templates in
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with validation scripts in Python and R scripts
to build RMarkdown-based lessons. All of this was orchestrated by a Makefile.
The purpose of this approach was two-fold:

1. To maintain a consistent style that emphasized our principles of
   evidence-based teaching such as learning objectives and formative assessment;
2. To demonstrate how the skills we teach in our workshops could be applied
   to real-life situations.

---

## Drawbacks

???

While this was conceptually good in theory, this infrastructure design has three
significant drawbacks for contributors:

1. Installation pains.
   <https://twitter.com/gvwilson/status/1380115181708189701?s=20> Having
   Jekyll, Python, and Make as dependencies means that people who want to build
   these lessons on their machines need all three of these successfully installed 
   and up-to-date.
   This is especially frustrating for Windows users who have none
   of these by default.
2. All the scripts live inside the repository. This means that lessons quickly
   become out of date as they diverge from the improvements made upstream.
3. Another drawback is that we have a lesson website wrapped around a static
   site generator (which in and of itself is a kind of desire path), this meant
   that it was easy to contribute to if you were familiar with how Jekyll
   operated. There is often a moment of panic in a new contributor's eyes when
   you show them what the a lesson repository looks like. If you were not
   familiar with Jekyll, then it was unclear where to even start if you were
   looking at the git repository because there were no clear sign that marked
   the trail head. This lead several lessons to find their own paths that ended
   up built in different ways.

Over the last few years, we have begun finding these desire paths all across our
lesson infrastructure. These manifested through our communication channels and
frustration from contributors and maintainers alike. The thing about desire
paths, though, is that they are not only challenges, but also opportunities.

## Chopportunities

???

At The Carpentries, we like to call these "chopportunities."

The growth that we have experienced in the past few years is a chopportunity.
We have seen not only a growth in the number of community members, but also,
in the number community contributed lessons since we started
The Carpentries Incubator.

Our challenge is clear: the all-in-one lesson infrastructure does not scale
well to the growing number of lessons.

## Chopportunity


???

Our opportunity here is to reimagine the infrastructure in a way that truly
values all contributions: this includes the spectrum from everyday educators
who want to share their knowledge, to the tinkerers who need to understand
what is going on behind the scenes.

## Solution

???


The solution we came up with uses R and I simply do not have enough time to
discuss all the features, but you can find out for yourself if you visit our
blog posts and documentation on how to get started.

So, how and why did we choose R to create the next iteration of our lesson
infrastructure?

---
background-image: url(jomo.jpeg)
background-size: 45%
background-repeat: no-repeat
background-position: right


### Challenge

???

We wanted a general solution where you could take markdown or RMarkdown files,
place them in a folder and generate a Carpentries-style lesson without having
complicated paths or generated files lying around. The first thing we did was
to investigate the existing landscape.

It was important that we choose something that is user friendly, easy to
install, easily customizable, and has a welcoming community behind it. We tried
out several static site generators, but the largest barrier for many of these
was that they were not easy to install and maintain.

## Why R?

--

1. fRiendly Communities!

--

2. Easy To Install

--

3. {knitr} + {RMarkdown} + _pandoc_

???

We settled on the fact that R is the best place to go for our needs
because:

1. First and foremost: R is chock-full of friendly communities!
  - RLadies
  - ROpenSci
  - RForwards
  - MiR
2. R is easy to install on all major operating systems and
   is available online via RStudio Cloud
3. R has a robust ecosystem for publishing thanks to {knitr} and RMarkdown

## Prior Art

???
Once we identified R as our solution, the natural place to go was one of the
RMarkdown variants like {blogdown} or {hugodown}, but we found that while the
tools were indeed separated from the content and the documentation was rich and
accessible, there were many aspects that would not fit our needs including the
presence of styling within the repository.

background-size: 45%
background-repeat: no-repeat
background-position: right 0%, right 100%


## Distributed Style

???

We realized that an unlikely contender, {pkgdown}, a documentation site
generator, used the same model that we were looking for: It meets people where
they are, content is pure markdown with no extra templating required, the tools
to build everything lived in a separate package, and you can customize its
appearance by making your own package to supply your CSS, JS, and HTML
templates.

---
background-image: url(rough-hex.png)
background-size: contain 
background-repeat: no-repeat
background-position: center 

???

From this model, we were able to pave over the desire paths in our
infrastructure by creating three packages to serve as the lesson engine,
styling, and validation:

 - {sandpaper} to orchestrate building and maintaining lessons
 - {varnish} to host the CSS, JS, and HTML templates
 - {pegboard} to serve as a validator (and converter!) for lesson content

background-position: right

## Entrypoint

???

Of course, the first thing any contributor will see is the folder structure. We
organized the folders of the lesson to reflect the layout of website dropdown
menus, so our lessons consist of folders that we use commonly: one folder for
lesson chapters, one for extra information for learners, one for extra
information for instructors, and one to contain learner profiles.

The final folder is one of the access panels that contains the rendered markdown
files---so you can use them in another context---and static website so that you
can put it on a USB stick and share it without needing to run a local server.

background-size: 45%
background-repeat: no-repeat

### Opportunity

???

Our solution ticks all the boxes that satisfy our design choices,
but if we ended up designing something that R enthusiasts
love, but is unusable by newcomers, Python, or Matlab folks, then we are not
in line with our value of being inclusive of all.

Our goal is for authors to focus on the content over the tooling.
We want lesson authors to create a lesson directly from the source
they already work with: markdown/RMarkdown/MyST notebooks.
To do this, we needed to test the minimal
viable product on actual maintainers and we needed to make sure that they were
spread across the spectrum of familiarity with:

 - using R,
 - the current infrastructure,
 - the way The Carpentries operates.

???

We recruited a total of 19 volunteers to run through Alpha Testing, which tested
the participants ability to install the required software and packages, create,
modify, and contribute to lessons. After the tests, I asked for 20-minute
open-ended interviews from the volunteers about their experience to identify
common stumbling blocks, challenges, and bright points. 

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who has participated, some of whom are
part of The Carpentries core team. I don't have the time to go into detail about
the results, but a big takeaway from this was that everyone was able to install
the infrastructure and any problems that occured were from Git/GitHub, which is
a big improvement over the current system.

## Conclusion


???

We have just finished with this first testing phase and the next step for us is
to address the questions and concerns that were brought up (for example: how do
I use this without clobbering the current R installation on my system?), improve
the documentation, and get ready for the beta release, where we will try it on a
few live lessons to identify painpoints for the community. It is a slow process,
but this way we can avoid major unforseen issues (minor issues are a given),
bring users in on the ground floor, get valuable feedback, and strengthen trust
with our community.

???

And I want to conclude by saying that we ended up choosing a solution that we
believe aligns with our values and will work with our community. We do not have
all the answers right now, but we go through this process because we want to
make sure we put people first and are always learning.
