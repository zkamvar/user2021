00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,960
hello

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,560
my name is Zhian Kamvar and I'm the

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,800
Lesson Infrastructure Technology

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,880
Developer at The Carpentries

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
and The Carpentries is a global

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,160
organization of volunteers who teach

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,240
foundational

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,920
data and coding skills to researchers

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,320
worldwide

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,240
what makes us stand out is not the fact

11
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,119
that we use evidence-based practices in

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,119
teaching

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,480
is that we align all of our decisions

14
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,039
with our core values;

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,960
we put people first and we value all

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,680
contributions.

17
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,600
Our lessons are distributed as open

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,680
licensed websites built on

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
a consistent style that adheres to

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,600
active learning principles.

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
We use these lessons as the source

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,000
material for the hundreds of workshops

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,879
we run

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,520
each year and these sites have three

25
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,039
distinct

26
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,640
audiences. First, the Car- the certified

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
Carpentries instructor

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
who refers to these materials as they

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,879
teach our workshops.

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
Next there are the learners in a

31
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,199
Carpentries workshop who rely

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,000
on these lessons after a workshop as

33
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,760
they review

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,080
and practice their newly acquired skills.

35
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,240
And last but not least there are the

36
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
educators like yourselves

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,200
who adapt these open license materials

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,520
for their own lessons.

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,240
The source for these lessons are hosted

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,880
on GitHub where volunteer maintainers

41
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,080
ensure that the lessons are accurate and

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
up to date

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,439
and we encourage a culture of open

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,600
contribution

45
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,799
where members of our community can

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,439
suggest improvements

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,240
like a simple typo fix or a better

48
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,200
explanation

49
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,680
of an important lesson concept and we

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
want

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,759
anyone to be able to go to the

52
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,200
repository and make a suggestion to

53
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,759
improve our lessons...

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
at least that was our intention and I

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,840
want to pause for a second here and

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,399
highlight this tweet that came across my

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
feed

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,439
as I was preparing for this talk. It

59
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,680
shows a fork between a paved path

60
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,719
and an unpaved footpath across a patch

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
of grass

62
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,119
which leads to a crosswalk. There's a

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,200
sign in front of the unpaved path

64
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,640
that says "please use the purpose made

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,959
path provided"

66
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,760
the tweet author points out that the

67
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,560
sign

68
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,640
knows it has lost. This unofficial

69
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,920
footpath is called a 'desire path'

70
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,920
and it is an important concept in design

71
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,239
because it shows the difference between

72
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,040
what the designers intended

73
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,840
and how people actually use the space.

74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,959
And as our

75
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,720
community has grown, new desire paths

76
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,640
were being created across our lesson

77
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,080
infrastructure landscape.

78
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,360
No signs, or in our case documentation,

79
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
would stop contributors to our to our

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
lessons from stepping

81
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
outside these complex, purpose-made paths

82
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,800
in our

83
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,480
lesson infrastructure and we needed to

84
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
rethink our infrastructure

85
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,599
all together in a way that is more

86
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,519
inclusive and welcoming for everybody.

87
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,000
And we found that the R publishing

88
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
ecosystem is flexible enough to give us

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,879
the tools we need

90
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,599
to reduce barriers for publishing

91
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,200
lessons and furthers our mission.

92
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,440
I will introduce you to our current

93
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,920
infrastructure, its unique challenges

94
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,840
our solutions, and how we use past and

95
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,480
present feedback from our community

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,760
to iteratively refine our design. But

97
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,640
before continuing,

98
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,280
I want to remind everyone of two things.

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
First

100
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,879
"There is no right or wrong only better

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,799
or worse."

102
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,640
Greg Wilson, the founder of Software

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,040
Carpentry, wrote this after several

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,640
iterations of the lesson infrastructure

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,879
and I'm putting it here as a reminder

106
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,920
that the infrastructure we have now

107
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,200
was working for us at the time and what

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,959
we come up with

109
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,680
will have its own difficulties down the

110
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,280
road, but what is important is that we

111
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,560
build something that better addresses

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,519
the needs of our community.

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,640
Which leads me to my second reminder: You

114
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
belong

115
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,519
in The Carpentries. As the community has

116
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,080
grown, our infrastructure has been put to

117
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
the test

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,000
and we have continuously updated our

119
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,799
workflows to make it easier for

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,200
people to contribute. The reason we do

121
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
this

122
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,799
is because we are driven by our values

123
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,239
and in The Carpentries, you belong; no

124
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,599
matter if you've been working as a

125
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,480
systems administrator

126
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,160
for university HPC cluster or if you

127
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,040
have just learned to write your first R

128
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,120
script.

129
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,400
And to better understand the decisions

130
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,240
we are making,

131
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,680
let's start by reviewing our current

132
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,479
infrastructure.

133
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,240
Our lessons are written in markdown and

134
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,400
transformed into a website

135
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,759
via GitHub pages and the Jekyll static

136
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,240
site generator.

137
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
The idea behind this choice was that it

138
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,280
was the most straightforward way to

139
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,440
create a static website

140
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,800
without needing a server like wordpress

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,639
or drupal sites.

142
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,560
Ideally, it also provided a way for

143
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,960
people to use this as an example of how

144
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,960
they can build their own website.

145
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,000
And the paradigm of being able to write

146
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,400
markdown lessons

147
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to get a functional website out of it is

148
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
not a new concept;

149
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,080
in fact there are 460 iterations of this

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
concept.

151
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,759
Jekyll happens to be the one that GitHub

152
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
implemented early on

153
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,960
to provide documentation for its open

154
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,560
source project

155
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,039
and thus it stuck. We created

156
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,680
an all-in-one bundle for lessons that

157
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,199
provided styling templates in HTML

158
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,039
CSS and JavaScript along with validation

159
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
scripts in Python

160
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,240
and our scripts to build our markdown-

161
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,160
based lessons.

162
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
All of this was orchestrated by a Make

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,199
file and the purpose of this full

164
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,360
approach was two-fold. First, to maintain a

165
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,160
consistent style that emphasized our

166
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
principle of

167
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
evidence-based teaching such as learning

168
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
objectives

169
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,639
and formative assessment, and second,

170
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
to demonstrate how the skills we teach

171
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
in our workshops

172
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,720
could be applied to real life situations.

173
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,919
And while this was conceptually good

174
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,600
in theory, this infrastructure design has

175
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,199
three significant drawbacks for

176
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
contributors.

177
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,960
The first is installation pains.

178
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,240
Having Jekyll, Python, and Make as

179
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,720
dependencies

180
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,720
means that the people who want to build

181
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
these lessons on their machines

182
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,919
need all three of these successfully

183
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,240
installed

184
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,000
and up-to-date. This is especially

185
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,120
frustrating for Windows users

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,319
who have none of these by default.

187
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,199
Secondly, with this design all of the

188
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,160
scripts live

189
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,000
inside of the repository and this leads

190
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,479
to the unfortunate pattern

191
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,680
where lessons quickly become out of date

192
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,479
as they diverge from

193
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,160
improvements that are made upstream.

194
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,360
Another drawback is that we have a

195
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
lesson website

196
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,479
wrapped around a static site generator

197
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
which

198
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,560
in and of itself is a kind of desire

199
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,440
path. And this meant that

200
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,240
it was easy to contribute if you were

201
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,400
familiar with how Jekyll operated.

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,800
There's often a moment of panic in a new

203
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,520
contributor's eyes when you show them

204
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,360
what the lesson repository looks like. If

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,919
you were not familiar with Jekyll then

206
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,400
it was unclear where to even start if

207
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,000
you were looking at the Git repository

208
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,759
because there was no clear sign that

209
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
marked the trailhead.

210
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,880
This led to several lessons to find

211
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,800
their own paths

212
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,160
that ended up being built in different

213
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,240
ways.

214
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,080
Over the last few years we have begun

215
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,440
finding these desire paths across our

216
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,039
lesson infrastructure.

217
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,199
These manifested through our

218
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,240
communication channels and frustration

219
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
from contributors

220
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,639
and maintainers alike; but the thing

221
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
about desire path though,

222
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,800
is that there are not only challenges,

223
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,880
but also opportunities.

224
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,599
And at The Carpentries we like to call

225
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,199
these 'chopportunities.'

226
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,639
The growth that we have experienced in

227
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
the past few years

228
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
is a 'chopportunity' and we have seen not

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,120
only a growth

230
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
in the number of community members but

231
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
also in the number

232
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,280
of community contributed lessons since

233
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,960
we started The Carpentries Incubator.

234
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,199
And our challenge is clear: the

235
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,039
all-in-one lesson infrastructure

236
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,960
does not scale well to the growing

237
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,759
number of lessons.

238
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
Our opportunity here is to reimagine the

239
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,599
infrastructure in a way that truly

240
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,599
values all contributions.

241
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,199
This includes the spectrum from everyday

242
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
educators who want to share their

243
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,800
knowledge

244
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,800
to the tinkerers who want access panels

245
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,319
to understand what is going on behind

246
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,199
the scenes.

247
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
And the solution we came up with uses R

248
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,240
and while I simply do not have enough

249
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,479
time to discuss

250
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,960
all of the features, you can find out for

251
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:28,000
yourself if you visit our blog posts

252
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,280
and documentation on how to get started.

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,800
So, how and why did we choose R to create

254
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,399
the next iteration of our lesson

255
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,320
infrastructure?

256
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,320
Well, we wanted a general solution where

257
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,039
you could take markdown or R markdown

258
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,959
files,

259
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
place them in a folder, and generate a

260
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,320
Carpentries-style lesson

261
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,560
without having complicated paths or

262
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,920
generated files lying around.

263
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,640
The first thing we did was to

264
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,240
investigate the existing landscape

265
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,000
and it was important that we choose

266
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,959
something that is user friendly, easy

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,279
to install, easily customizable, and has a

268
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
welcoming community behind it.

269
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,120
We tried out several static site

270
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,040
generators, but the largest

271
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,240
barrier for many of these was that they

272
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,640
were not easy to install and maintain.

273
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,839
We settled on the fact that R is the

274
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,640
best place to go for our needs because

275
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,399
first and foremost, R is chock full of

276
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,120
friendly communities

277
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,640
such as R-ladies, rOpenSci, and R

278
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,760
forwards.

279
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,600
R is also easy to install on all major

280
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
operating systems and is available

281
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
online by

282
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,720
RStudio Cloud. And, last, R has a robust

283
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,839
ecosystem

284
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
for publishing thanks to knitr and R

285
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,720
markdown.

286
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,640
So once we identified R as our solution,

287
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,560
the natural place to go

288
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,480
was one of the R markdown variants like

289
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,480
blogdown or hugodown.

290
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,240
But we found that while the tools were

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,240
indeed separate from the content

292
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,519
and the documentation was rich and

293
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,279
accessible,

294
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,760
there were many aspects that would not

295
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,519
fit our needs. In particular,

296
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,959
the presence of styling inside the

297
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,760
repository

298
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,839
meaning that the user was ultimately

299
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
responsible for maintaining the visual

300
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,880
presence.

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,920
We realized that an unlikely contender,

302
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
pkgdown,

303
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,560
a document site generator, used the exact

304
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
same model that we were looking for.

305
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,399
It meets people where they are, content

306
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,920
is pure markdown with no extra

307
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,079
templating required,

308
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,000
the tools build everything- to build

309
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,480
everything lived in a separate package,

310
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,399
and you can customize its appearance by

311
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,360
making your own package to supply your

312
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,680
CSS JavaScript and HTML templates.

313
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
which has been done many times for

314
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
individual

315
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,079
and organization-wide documentation.

316
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,519
So from this model we were able to pave

317
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,399
our own desire paths in our

318
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,560
infrastructure

319
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:49,120
by creating three R packages: sandpaper

320
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,200
is the engine that orchestrates building

321
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,360
and maintaining lessons;

322
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,320
varnish is the styling that hosts the

323
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,120
CSS JavaScript and HTML templates;

324
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
and pegboard serves as the validator and

325
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
be-

326
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
and converter behind the scenes for

327
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
lesson content.

328
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,640
Of course the first thing any

329
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
contributor will see is the folder

330
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
structure.

331
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,160
And it will help if this resembles the

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,600
structure of the lesson website.

333
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,600
So our lessons consist of folders

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,640
that correspond to the website drop down

335
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,880
menus;

336
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,480
one folder for lesson chapters, one for

337
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,839
extra information for learners,

338
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
one for extra information for

339
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,600
instructors, and one to contain learner

340
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,839
profiles.

341
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
The final folder is one of the access

342
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
panels that contains the rendered

343
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,560
markdown files so you can use them in

344
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,200
another context

345
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,320
and a static website so you can put it

346
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,079
on a usb stick

347
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,640
and share it without additional software

348
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,480
like Hugo or Jekyll.

349
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,399
And our solution ticks all the boxes

350
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,959
that satisfy our design choices,

351
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,760
but if we end up science- designing

352
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,360
something that

353
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,320
R enthusiasts love, but is unusable by

354
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,519
newcomers

355
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,200
Python or Matlab folks, then we are not

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
in line with our value of being

357
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,839
inclusive

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,920
of all. Our goal is for authors to focus

359
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,920
on the content over the tooling

360
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
and we want lesson authors to create

361
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
lessons directly

362
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,959
from the source they already work with

363
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,839
be it markdown, R markdown, or MyST

364
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,440
notebooks.

365
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,200
And to do this we need to test the

366
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,079
minimal viable product

367
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
on actual maintainers and we need to make

368
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,480
sure

369
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,839
that they were spread across the

370
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,440
familiar- spectrum

371
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,839
of familiarity with using R,

372
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,000
the current infrastructure, and even the

373
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,519
way The Carpentries operates.

374
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
So we recruited a total of 19 volunteers

375
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,800
to run through

376
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,720
alpha testing which tested the

377
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
participants ability to install the

378
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,079
required software and packages,

379
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,720
create, modify, and contribute to lessons.

380
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,720
After the tests I asked for 20 minute

381
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,839
open-ended interviews from volunteers

382
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,839
about their experience to

383
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,959
identify common stumbling blocks,

384
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
challenges,

385
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,880
and bright points. And I want to take a

386
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
moment to thank everyone who has

387
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,160
participated

388
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,120
some of who are part of the Carpentries

389
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,800
core team.

390
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,639
And I don't have the time to go into

391
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,519
detail about the results but

392
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,399
a big takeaway from this was that

393
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,240
everyone

394
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
was able to install the infrastructure

395
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,120
and any problems that occurred

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
were largely from Git and GitHub which

397
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,040
is a big

398
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,880
improvement over our current system.

399
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,279
So we have just finished the testing

400
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,160
phase- the first testing phase and the

401
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,720
next step for us

402
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,079
is to address the questions and concerns

403
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
that were brought up

404
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,200
for example, "how do I use this without

405
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,440
clobbering the current R

406
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,360
installation on my system?" We need to

407
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,320
improve documentation and get ready for

408
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,920
the beta release

409
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,920
which we will try it on a few live

410
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
lessons to identify pain points for the

411
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,320
community.

412
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,399
It is a slow process, but this way we can

413
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,720
avoid major unforeseen issues,

414
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
(minor issues are a given) we can bring

415
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,519
users in

416
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
on the ground floor, get valuable

417
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,560
feedback, and strengthen trust

418
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,399
within our community. And I want to

419
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,000
conclude by saying that we ended up

420
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,160
choosing a solution that we believe

421
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,760
aligns with our values and will work

422
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,399
with our community.

423
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,320
We do not have all the answers right now,

424
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,120
but we go through this process

425
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
because we want to make sure we put

426
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,360
people first

427
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,639
and are always learning.

428
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,240
And none of this would have been

429
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,000
possible without generous grants from

430
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,

431
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,320
the Moore Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg

432
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,720
Initiative, and the R Consortium

433
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,680
infrastructure steering committee. And

434
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,320
finally

435
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,079
thank you to all of our alpha testers,

436
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
The Carpentries community,

437
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,440
and all the folks who have taken time to

438
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,920
sit down and talk with me about

439
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,600
early drafts of the new infrastructure.

440
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,440
And thank you

441
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,360
for attending this presentation and I'd

442
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,959
be happy to take any questions.

443
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,959
Thank you.
